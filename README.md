## Installation

1. **Download and Install Emulators**: 
   - Download your favorite emulators (e.g., Citra, Project64, etc.) and place them in the `Cores` folder.
   
2. **Download ROMs**: 
   - Place your ROM files (e.g., `.iso`, `.gba`, `.nes`) in the `Roms` folder, categorized by emulator (e.g., `Roms/N64` for N64 games).

3. **Run the Script**: 
   - Double-click `SuqoLauncher.bat` to launch the application.
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to select an emulator and a ROM to play.

## Usage

1. **Select an Emulator**: 
   After running the script, you will be prompted to choose an emulator by number. Select the emulator you want to use.

2. **Select a ROM**: 
   Once you've selected an emulator, the script will list available ROMs in the selected directory. Choose the ROM you want to play.

3. **Enjoy the Game**: 
   The selected emulator will launch with the chosen ROM. Have fun playing your games!

## Troubleshooting

- If the script can't find your emulator, make sure it's placed correctly in the `Cores` folder.
- If the script can't find any ROMs, check that your ROMs are in the correct directory (e.g., `Roms/N64` for N64 ROMs).
- If using compressed ROM files (e.g., `.zip`, `.7z`), ensure that the compression format is supported by the emulator.
